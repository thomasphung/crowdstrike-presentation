## The Who, The What, and The Where

- CrowdStrike offers a platform, "Falcon", that acts as a single pane of glass in monitoring of cybersecurity threats
    - Used in many market sectors: healthcare, public utilities, transportation, finance, etc.
- Faulty configuration file update to one of Falcon software agents caused system outages
- ~8.5 million Windows machines affected worldwide (<1% of all Windows machines)
- Emergency response affected, rely on pen-and-paper or backup system; luckily no reported fatalities

CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that provides security products to Fortune 500, governments, critical infrastructure, small businesses, and more. Can think of it like a glorified antivirus for large organizations.

If you are not familiar with this space (like me), then you probably haven't heard about CrowdStrike until last month when 8.5 million Windows machine worldwide experienced the blue screen of death, causing system outages and service disruption.

Luckily there was no reported casualties and organizations resolved this situation in a fairly short amount of time (in my opinion). So what happened?

On Friday July 19th, CrowdStrike deployed an update to a configuration file that caused one of their software agents to crash out. Because their agent operates on the kernel level, once a machine downloads the faulty update and restarts, the OS loads the offending file, machine cannot boot, and blue screens. Even though CrowdStrike deployed a bugfix remotely 2 hours after the incident, affected machines were stuck in a bootloop and thus cannot download the fix, requiring manual intervention (boot into Safe Mode, delete offending file, and restart).

According to CrowdStrike, around 11 days after the incident, ~99% of affected machines were back online. Though that is still ~85,000 machines left. But that number should be near zero as of today (hopefully).

On Tuesday August 6th, 19 days after the incident, Crowdstrike released a 12-page report of their investigation and identified multiple failures in their software development and deployment practices that compounded into this mess.

## The Culprit(s)

::: {.fragment .semi-fade-out} 
> "The <span class="highlight">new IPC Template Type defined 21 input parameter fields</span>, but the integration code that invoked the Content Interpreter with <span class="highlight">Channel File 291â€™s Template Instances supplied only 20 input values</span> to match against. <span class="highlight">This parameter count mismatch evaded multiple layers of build validation and testing</span>, as it was not discovered during the sensor release testing process, the Template Type (using a test Template Instance) stress testing or the first several successful deployments of IPC Template Instances in the field. In part, this was due to the use of wildcard matching criteria for the 21st input during testing and in the initial IPC Template Instances."

In plain language (thanks Copilot):
> "The blueprint had 21 settings, but the system only had 20. This mistake slipped past several checks because of how the system handled one of the settings. Itâ€™s like building a house with a missing brick, and <s>nobody noticed until later!</s> <u>the house collapsed!</u> ðŸ˜…"

In their Root Cause Analysis document, CrowdStrike mentioned they pushed a faulty update to a config file of one of their software agents (Windows Falcon sensor).

This error was not flagged by their automated unit testing and integration tests and was deployed to all 8.5 million Windows machines who had CrowdStrike's Falcon software installed.
:::

## The Culprit - Out of Bounds Error

- Update to configuration file template contained an additional input (21 elements)
- Hard-coding an array access to the 21st element when the configuration file omitted it
- Classic out of bounds read issue ([CWE-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html))
    - Top 25 software vulnerabilities according to Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

::: {.notes}

This faulty update caused a classic out of bounds error where somewhere in their software, they were hard-coding access to a 21st element that was missing from a config file. In other words, they were asking for information that doesn't exist and they didn't properly handle that error. As a last resort, Windows gives you the blue screen.
:::

## The Culprit - Out of Bounds Error Fix

- One if statement protects against this; do input validation
    - Example from CWE (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html):

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Insecure code:
```C
int getValueFromArray(int *array, int length, int index) {

    int value;

    // get the value at the specified index of the array
    value = array[index];

    return value;
}
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
More secure code:
```C
int getValueFromArray(int *array, int length, int index) {

    int value;

    // check that the array index is within the correct
    // range of values for the array
    if (index >= 0 && index < length) {
        
        // get the value at the specified index of the array
        value = array[index];
    }
    // if array index is invalid then output error message
    // and return value indicating error
    else {
        printf("Value is: %d\n", array[index]);
        value = -1;
    }

    return value;
}
```
:::

::::

::: {.notes}

Sample solution from Common Weakness Enumeration, written in C language. For some reason, Crowdstrike devs didn't do input validation to prevent getting data beyond what's available. Very simple fix to make secure code, but it's scary to know that this amateur error can happen to such a large organization like CrowdStrike. This demonstrates no matter who you are, security vulnerabilities can creep into your product. This is why you have robust test coverage.
:::

## The Culprit - Oversight In Testing

- Usage of catch-all wildcard pattern in RegEx in tests to pass faulty configuration file.
    - Inconsistency between mock config files passed to validation code vs. actual config files used in production
- No known integration test to catch this issue.
    - Pushing your changes to a local Windows machine and turning it on-and-off would likely catch this bug.

```C

```

But CrowdStrike's tests failed to catch this insecure code. Their config file validation code also failed to do input validation. Their tests do not match their production environment.

## Not An Isolated Issue

Unfortunately this is not the year of the Linux desktop. Earlier this year, there was a Linux kernel bug that caused an issue with CrowdStrike's Falcon software that fell under the media's radar. Though not necessarily CrowdStrike's fault, I want to highlight that security issues can happen on any operating system.

## My Takeaways
Security is two-part mitigation and remediation. 1. Reduce risk and 2. Bounce back from an unlikely incident.

<!-- In increasing order of complexity to implement -->

So I'm over here scratching my head and asking why is such a large and pervasive company like CrowdStrike a single point of failure for a lot of organizations? In the realm of security and cybersecurity, you are not too big to fail. Everyone is vulnerable, but you can reduce risk of incidents through prevention steps and recover through remediation practices.

- No matter who you are on a project, please embed the culture of not deploying to your production environment on a Friday. In the event where something goes wrong, your Operations team should be immediately available, monitor the situation, and take the necessary steps to remediate.
- Security is everyone's responsibility. Have healthy paranoia and skepticism around your security posture and ask questions to verify stuff like "what are our single points of failure?" and "what is our SOP in an emergency". I wouldn't settle for less if there is critical infrastructure that is capable of disrupting and harming lives.
- Trust, but verify. Don't solely rely on upstream dependencies for security practices or disaster recovery. It should also be your responsibilty. Be friends with your security steward or security office to protect your products from others and yourself. Don't think of them as a blocker, foster a collaborative relationship to ensure everyone is safe.
- Have a robust testing suite but don't limit it to testing business logic. Nowadays, "everything as code" which enables automation but opens the attack surface. So perform automated testing and scans as part of your CI/CD on infrastructure as code files, secrets data store, environment variable files, etc. And make sure your tests have full coverage.
- If you pushing updates remotely to customers, please do staggered deployments and not all 8.5 million Windows machines, so you can monitor your changes' in production workloads and do rollbacks before crashes, security vulnerabilities, etc. affect everyone.
- I have been clowning on CrowdStrike but I would like to address all the organizations who are using their product. Procuring a security product is not the end-all be-all of having a secure system. If you don't have the resources to do recovery in a reasonable amount of time, I would argue not having that system in the first place. Organizations tend to have security as an afterthought as they pidegonhole themselves into boosting business/operational value (move fast and break things) but please slow down and invest in cybersecurity practices or talent. Don't make security an afterthought. If you have trouble justifying others the importance of security, frame the conversation around risk management and point to CrowdStrike as a case study.
- Integrate security from the beginning and throughout a project lifecycle. You can do this even if you are not a security person. There are tabletop exercises that you can involve your product people, developers, testers, security, operations, leadership, etc. to help devise plans and start thinking about security.
    - I don't expect everyone to be perfect. We all make mistakes. But there should be processes in place to catch these mistakes before they blow up into something big. And in the very rare instance that big thing happens, give out $10 gift cards to add salt to injury. /s
