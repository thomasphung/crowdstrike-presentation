## The Who, The What, and The Where

- CrowdStrike offers a platform, "Falcon", that acts as a single pane of glass in monitoring of cybersecurity threats
- Faulty update to one of Falcon software agents caused system outages
- ~8.5 million Windows machines affected worldwide

::: {.notes}
CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that provides security products to Fortune 500, governments, critical infrastructure, small businesses, etc. Can think of it like a glorified antivirus.

They have their hands in a lot of market sectors so they are considered as industry leaders in the security sector. 

If you are not in the cyber space, then you probably haven't heard about this company until last month when 8.5 million Windows computers around the world experienced the blue screen of death, causing system outages and delays.

So what happened is that on July 19th, CrowdStrike deployed an update

## The Culprit

> "CrowdStrike was founded with a mission to protect customers against todayâ€™s adversaries and stop breaches. On July 19, 2024, as part of regular operations, <span class="highlight">CrowdStrike released a content configuration update (via channel files) for the Windows sensor that resulted in a system crash.</span> We apologize unreservedly."

## Learnings
Security is two-part mitigation and remediation. 1. Reduce risk and 2. Bounce back from an unlikely incident.

- No Deploy Fridays
- Security is everyone's responsibility; "a chain is only as strong as its weakest link"
    - Trust, but verify; don't solely rely on upstream dependencies for security practices or disaster recovery
- Don't just scan code. Data and configuration files are also attack vectors
- Have a backup plan

::: {.notes}
So I'm over here scratching my head and asking why is such a large and pervasive company like CrowdStrike vulnerable to insider threats? You hear all the hype around implementing AI into products and even CrowdStrike is advertising themselves as the "future of AI-powered cybersecurity" In the realm of security and cybersecurity, you are not too big to fail.

- No matter who you are on a project, please embed the culture of not deploying to your production environment on a Friday. In the event where something goes wrong, your Operations team should immediately be available, monitor the situation, and take the necessary steps to remediate
- Have healthy paranoia and skepticism around your security posture and ask questions to verify them. I wouldn't settle for less if there is critical infrastructure that is capable of disrupting and causing harm to lives.
- I have been focusing on CrowdStrike but I would like to address all the organizations who are using their product
